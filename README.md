# Git-Util

A simple project to push code to multiple branches in Git

## How it works

This project involves running a React app and a NodeJS application together. The react acts as a UI, and the node as a controller for git bash.

I am planning to integrate it with electron in order to create a desktop application that can be used to push code.

Open for more suggestions, please feel free to reach out!
